This project contains miscellaneous scripts that are commonly used for
scripts.  They are released in the public domain.

Files for manipulating CARP meshes:
 * carp_all2carp_tet - Takes in a hybrid carp mesh and returns a carp tetrahedral mesh.
 * create_fibers - Use this script as a template to create your own fibers.
 * extract_edges - extracts the edges from a .tri file.
 * fix_unreferenced_nodes - finds any nodes that aren't part of an element and removes them.
 * make_carp_2d_grid - makes a 2d grid
 * make_carp_regular_grid - makes a 3D slab of tissue
 * make_carp_cylindrical_shell - makes a cylindrical grid.
 * remove_region - removes a region from a mesh.
 * set_algebra - Helps with the construction of .vtx files.
 * triangle_convert - converts a mesh generated with "triangle" into a carp mesh.
 * surfaces_only - removes nodes that aren't a part of a surface.

Files for processing CARP output files:
 * apd - takes in a .dat file of times and voltages.  Finds APD
 * curvature.py - measure the curvature of a CARP mesh.
 * expand_dat.py - takes a intracellular dat file as input, expands it to the extracellular space.
 * gracetim - outputs a stimulus current for 1D visualization purposes
 * igb_data.m & igb_size.m - functions for reading in IGB files in MATLAB (tm) or octave
 * igbtools.py - general utility scripts for manipulating IGB files.
 * meshalyzer_fibers - processes the .lon file so it can be viewed in Meshalyzer

Miscellaneous utility scripts
 * header_guard - puts a guard on a header so it isn't included multiple times.  Can be run over and over in succession.
 * pcut - a version of cut that uses perl regex for spaces to separate columns
